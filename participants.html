        <p>Dr Alejandro Jiménez Rios is a Civil Engineer graduated from the University of Guadalajara (UDG), Mexico. He obtained the double title of Advanced Master's Degree in the Structural Analysis of Monuments and Historical Constructions (SAHC) by the Czech Technical University, Czech Republic, and by the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Spain. At Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, he got a postgraduate diploma in statistics and also a PhD in Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering. He worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Structural and Geotechnical Engineering of the Faculty of Architecture at the Sapienza University of Rome, Italy.</p>

        <p>As part of the DTADD project, he worked as a MSCA Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Built Environment, Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway, held a distinguished ICCROM Fellowship with the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM), Italy and was hosted at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Delft University of Technology, Netherlands, during a three-month secondment. Currently, he works as Lecturer in Structural Engineering at the <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-architecture-civil-engineering/" target="_blank" ><b>Department of Architecture & Civil Engineering</b></a>, <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/homepage/" target="_blank" ><b>University of Bath</b></a>, UK.</p>

        <p>His research focuses on preserving and maintaining historic buildings and bridges. He studies traditional and eco-friendly architecture and investigate how materials like masonry, bamboo, and earth behave under different conditions. This involves using methods that don't damage the structures and conducting large-scale tests. He also works on making buildings more robust and resilient. Additionally, he explores how new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and digital twins, can be used in architecture, construction, and engineering to improve the way structures are monitored and managed.</p>

        <p>Dr Francisco Javier Castilla Pascual is an Associate Professor in the <a href="https://www.uclm.es/departamentos/maplicada" target="_blank" ><b>Department of Mechanical engineering</b></a>, <a href="https://www.uclm.es/" target="_blank" ><b>University of Castilla La Mancha</b></a>, Spain. He teaches at the school of engineering in the Degree and Master of Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering.</p>

        <p>Francisco got his Bachelor Degree in architecture by the School of Architecture at the  Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM) in 1995. He is a specialist in installations and facilities in building refurbishment and renovation. He obtained his PhD from the UPM in 2004, as a result of four years Grant (1996-1999) for university teaching training. Since 1999 he has been sharing my time between professional works and academic activities at the University.</p>

        <p>Two main lines have kept his interest since he started his pre-doctorate research until now, and one lead to the other. Building with earth: Traditional and new earth construction techniques (rammed earth, compressed earth blocks, adobe, and clay plaster). He has participated in several national research projects and also as consultant in earth construction for some modern buildings. Energy efficiency and sustainable construction in buildings and environmental assessment: He is associated member and hold the title of EA (Evaluador Acreditado) by Green Building Council - España (2011), and he is also an associated member of the Spanish passivhaus association. (Plataforma Española Passivhaus). As a result of his involvement in this issue he led his university team in the international competition SOLARDECATHLON2014, where they focused their project “syimbcity” on the regeneration of existing buildings and experimented passive and bioclimatic design strategies as the main issue to get indoor comfort conditions. He is also a researcher on the current I+D national projects: «Calibration of BIM models by means of low cost sensors for the energy optimization of buildings», «BIM Thermal: automatic creation and monitoring of three-dimensional thermal models in building interiors»</p>

        <p>Anushka Gupta is an undergraduate architecture student at the <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-architecture-civil-engineering/" target="_blank" ><b>Department of Architecture & Civil Engineering</b></a>, <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/homepage/" target="_blank" ><b>University of Bath</b></a>.</p>

        <p>She strives to be a socially conscious, ecologically responsible and culturally intelligent architect. She is interested in the architect's ability to orchestrate the experience of space at the building-scale; and facilitate community-led retrofit at the neighbourhood scale.</p>

        <p>She recently gained experience working in India and also with an architectural technologist in the UK. She completed a paid and highly competitive internship at NLA - home to London's Built Environment, where she organised and attended a programme of events, awards and the London Festival of Architecture. Her manager, Grace Simmonds, commended her ability to adapt proactively to changing situations.</p>

        <p>She has organised large-scale events such as an inter-university student competition and the stuCAN festival as part of the Architect's Climate Action Network (ACAN) to supplement a climate-aware architectural education. Matthew Pembery, a former ACAN Education co-ordinator and Bath alumni, described her as 'a community maker with a lot of drive and passion.'</p>
